# Query's Quest
Query's Quest is an console adventure game based off of an early 90's computer game called Chip's Challenge. Chip's Challenge was one of the first video games I ever played, so it has a special place in my heart. It was fun to create my own version on it, and I look forward to improving it as my skills progress.

The game is played on a 2D game board with several rooms containing different obstacles. Query must collect enough queries (?) in order to unlock the final gate. Along the way, Query may encounter locked doors, slippery ice, or deadly fire and water. Query may also find special boots to protect him from the elements, as well as keys to unlock doors. 

Eventually, I would like to develope a GUI for this game, and then potentially add more levels, just like the game that inspired it. 

## Usage
Use the arrow keys to navigate through the game board. Collect items and queries to solve the puzzle.
